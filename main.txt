Life can frequently appear baffling and uncontrollable.
 But don't give up. 
 God is putting together a plan for you. 
 You would start to rejoice and give thanks to God right now
  if you could only see the outcome He has in store for you. 
  SAY THIS: I will trust God to work everything out according to His plan for my life

There must be something about you that is progressing. 
Our God is progressive; nothing about Him is retrogressive. 
When God is in a thing, that thing must grow.
Be it a church, career, profession, marriage, business, or outfit. 
It could be challenging, but you will see incremental development.


Holy and Righteous Father, for your grace, which saved me. 
Please help me show your character and grace in everything I do,
so that when people see me and know I'm a Christian, 
they'll praise you for the service they've seen me do. 
In Jesus' precious name I pray. Amen.
